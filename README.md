# Current state
After a year of development one of the founders and a team member decided to step away due to some personal issues.

Because of that decision **there is no longer a JS/TS developer on the GeoChatter team**.

***This means unfortunately GeoChatter is currently not developed any further.***

The required server structure is up and running, ensuring that the **current state of the software is usable**.

We will still offer bug fixes and we might revive the project in the future.

Thank you for all the support!
